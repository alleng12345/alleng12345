- 👋 Hi, I’m @alleng12345
- 👀 I am interested in learning game development as well as mobile app development.
- 🌱 I am currently running through the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D" course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/share/101WeyBEUTeVlRRXg=/ 
- 💞️ I am not currently looking for any collaboration because I have no idea what I am doing. I am also very upset because I just lost 3 + hours of work trying to use Unity Collaboration between my 2 pc's. So now I am on GitHub to use their tools to keep moving forward.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
